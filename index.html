        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business Majorüìã</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Gianna Gum and I‚Äôm a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. Let me begin with some background information. I attended William ‚ÄúJ.‚Äù Pete Knight High School for all four of my years. I was extremely involved in high school, more so towards my later years than in my beginning ones. My freshman and sophomore years I was a part of a hip-hop dancing troupe that I was dedicated to, and I also joined a program called the Digital Design and Engineering Academy my sophomore year. My junior year is when I really branched out and became heavily involved. I joined an organization called Link Crew, which was a freshman mentor aid program. I dedicated a part of my summer and every other morning to counselling and aiding freshman in any way that I could. I also joined the Associated Student Body, which led me to be involved with most all the activities that went on during the school year. The final thing that I joined was Yearbook, which satisfied my love for digital design. I also took on a heavy course load of 6 Advanced Placement classes, all of which I ended up passing. I really pushed and tested my capacity levels this year. Senior Year I did all the same except I stopped doing Link Crew and only took 3 AP classes, while I headed up the ranks in my other organizations. I became the Head Editor of my Yearbook class and I also became the Activities Committee Chair for the Associated Student Body.<br><br>

        Transitioning to my starting of college, coming into my first quarter at UCR I was extremely excited. UCR from the beginning had always felt like the right option for me, as it was one of the three UC‚Äôs that offered a business major and it had an organization that is heavily focused on event programming. Starting off at UCR, it was everything I ever could have imagined, and even more. To go from a small town where not much happens to an extremely diverse and opportunity filled institution is quite a shock, in a good way. I took advantage of everything I could right away, and immediately fell in love with the school. I applied to the Associated Students Programming Board that is responsible for campus entertainment, and I ended up getting in! 
<br><br>

        ASPB has quickly become my main focus coming into winter quarter, as one of the main reasons I chose to attend UCR was so that I could join this organization. I have only just begun to be a part of it, yet I feel as though I‚Äôve learned and experienced much growth. ASPB is highly professional, organized, and filled with the most lively people I have ever met. I am quickly developing the skills necessary to coordinate large scale events, and I have been working most all the events put on by ASPB. I plan on becoming more heavily involved in the organization and seeing where I can contribute further, as my future career goal is to be an event programmer of some type.
